Description:
             This script will rename all files in the current directory            
             by decimal numbers. This script is meant to be an Anime/Series renamer
             to avoid to do it manually.                                           

IMPORTANT:                                                                                                    
        - Symbolic links will be ignored.                                  
        - Do not EVER change the name to the script!!!                          
        - Files must be ordered otherwise the script won't rename them correctly

ATTENTION: Do not execute this script twice with the same files because It may crush    
           your files.
